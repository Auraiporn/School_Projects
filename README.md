# School_Projects

Coding projects from school assignments

Java

o CS1400_Programming_Prob_Solving

• Final Project 
	- Implemented Ship class, Cruise class, and Cargo class to demonstrate the use of polymorphism in Java. 

• Guessing_Game
	- Created a guessing number game where it allows the user to enter the guess numbers until the user guess the correct secret number that a computer generates.

• Periodic_Table
	- Built a program that reads an input file which contains information about periodic table and writes the periodic table sorted by atomic weight or symbol to an output file with proper String format.

• Quadratic_EquationSolver
	- Implemented a program that computes a quadratic equation.


o CS2400_Data_Structure

• Pile_of_Books_(Project1)
	- Designed a class that is used to track the books in the pile on a desk by using data structures with the implementation of an array and a chain of linked nodes. 
	- Wrote a Java interface for the pile of books’ methods.

• Stack_(Project2)
	- Redesigned Pile_of_Books implementations following the interface of stack with the use of vector.

• Tree_(Project3)
	- Implemented the Binary Tree structure with recursive methods for some operations of the BinaryTree class and/or the BinaryNode class.

• Max_Heap_(Project4)
	- Implemented Max Heap structure to build a heap using sequential insertions and using optimal method
	
o CS3310_Design_and_Anlys_of_Algorithm

• Kth_Selection_Problem
	- Implemented the Kth_Selection_Problem algorithms to compare the time complexities and to perform detailed algorithm analysis 
	- Created the testing strategies to determine the performance of the algorithms to ensure the correctness of the program by collecting data and determining the data pattern according to theoretical complexity comparisons 

o CS3800_Computer_Network

• Socket_Programming _(Sending_a_file)
	- Created a server where it receives a file from a client and echoes the file back to the client 
	- Developed test strategies to evaluate the performance of the network 

o CS4800_Concepts_of_Programming_Languages

• Exception_Handling
	- Solved a small coding exercise to illustrate the exception handling in Java such as raising an exception when failing to open a file or checking for a valid input. 

• Reverse_List
	- Implemented a function to reverse a list of integers by using a tail recursion and iterative method. 

• Swap
	- Created a program that demonstrates a Java swap method that could swap values of two integer variables and two objects.  

MIPS

o CS2640_Comp_Org_and_Assembly_Prog
• Insertion_Sort
	- Built a program that prompts a user to enter 10 numbers and ask the user to choose one option of how to sort the numbers, i.e., in descending order or ascending order, then the program displays sorted list of numbers. 

Python

o CS4800_Concepts_of_Programming_Languages
• BubbleSort
	- Implemented a bubble sort algorithm to sort unsorted list of numbers.

• General_Sort_Method
	- Created a class to illustrates a general sort method that can sort any types of data arrays/lists such as sorting a list of integers, doubles, names, or student objects.
